# Polyline Measure Interpolation

This repository contains a Python script that uses `arcpy` and `numpy` to update the geometry of polyline features with interpolated measure values. The script calculates cumulative distances between polyline vertices and linearly interpolates measure values for each vertex.

## Prerequisites

- [ArcGIS Pro] (https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/overview) with the `arcpy` package.
- Python 3.x.
- `numpy` library.

## Script Overview

### distance(point1, point2)
Calculates the Euclidean distance between two points.

```python
def distance(point1, point2):
    return np.sqrt((point2[0] - point1[0])**2 + (point2[1] - point1[1])**2)
```

### interpolate_distances(points)
Calculates cumulative distances for the provided points and linearly interpolates measure values.

```python
def interpolate_distances(points):
    interpolated_points = []
    total_distance = 0.0
    
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        dist = distance(points[i-1], points[i])
        total_distance += dist
        interpolated_points.append([points[i][0], points[i][1], total_distance])
    
    for i in range(1, len(interpolated_points)):
        interpolated_points[i][2] = np.interp(
            interpolated_points[i][2],
            [0, total_distance],
            [points[0][2], points[-1][2]]
        )
    
    return interpolated_points
```

### update_geometry_with_measures(polyline, measures)
Updates the geometry of the polyline with measure values.

```python
def update_geometry_with_measures(polyline, measures):
    updated_geometry = arcpy.Array()
    
    for part in polyline:
        for i in range(part.count):
            point = part.getObject(i)
            measure = measures[i] if i < len(measures) else None
            point.M = measure
            updated_geometry.add(point)
    
    updated_polyline = arcpy.Polyline(updated_geometry)
    
    return updated_polyline
```

### Main Script
Iterates over polyline features, calculates measure values, and updates geometry.

```python
polyline_fc = r"Road_Segments"
from_measure_field = 'frommeasure'
to_measure_field = "tomeasure"

with arcpy.da.UpdateCursor(polyline_fc, ["SHAPE@", from_measure_field, to_measure_field]) as cursor:
    for row in cursor:
        polyline = row[0]
        from_measure = row[1]
        to_measure = row[2]
        
        vertices = [[point.X, point.Y, None] for part in polyline for point in part]
        vertices[0][2] = from_measure
        vertices[-1][2] = to_measure
        
        interpolated_points = interpolate_distances(vertices)
        interpolated_points = [vertices[0]] + interpolated_points
        measures = [point[2] for point in interpolated_points]
        
        updated_polyline = update_geometry_with_measures(polyline, measures)
        
        cursor.updateRow([updated_polyline, from_measure, to_measure])

print("Geometry updated with measure values.")
```

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have ArcGIS Pro installed and the `arcpy` package is available.
2. Clone this repository or download the script.
3. Open the script in your preferred Python IDE or text editor.
4. Modify the `polyline_fc`, `from_measure_field`, and `to_measure_field` variables as needed.
5. Run the script.
